# GitHub Pages Deployment

This build is configured for GitHub Pages deployment at:
https://[your-username].github.io/runproeducation2025/

## Important Notes

1. This app uses history mode routing with a 404.html fallback
2. All assets use the base path /runproeducation2025/
3. To deploy this build:
   - Push this dist folder to the gh-pages branch
   - Or use GitHub Actions to automate deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with routing or assets not loading:
- Verify that your GitHub Pages site is published
- Make sure the repository name matches exactly: "runproeducation2025"
- Check browser console for 404 errors on assets
